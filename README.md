# vue-validity

*WIP*

> A simple, clean and powerful validation library for Vue.js 2.0.

- Model-based validation originally forked from [vuelidate](https://github.com/monterail/vuelidate)
- Set custom errors (eg. errors that come from a service) via $setErrors.
- Create custom validators along with custom errors.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

npm run build
```
